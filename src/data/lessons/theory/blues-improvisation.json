It's 12 bars long using three chords (I, IV, V):\n\n• Bars 1-4: I chord (C)\n• Bars 5-6: IV chord (F)\n• Bars 7-8: I chord (C)\n• Bar 9: V chord (G)\n• Bar 10: IV chord (F)\n• Bars 11-12: I chord (C)\n\nYou can improvise over this using the blues scale!"

      "description": "When improvising blues:\n\n• Bend into the blue note (F#) from below — slide up from F\n• Use call-and-response: play a phrase, pause, then 'answer' it\n• End phrases on C or G for stability\n• Mix short punchy notes with long held notes\n• Don't be afraid of silence — space is powerful\n\nThe blues scale works over ALL three chords in a 12-bar blues. That's the beauty of it!"
