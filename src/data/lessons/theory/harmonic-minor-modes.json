      "description": "Modes are scales built by starting on different notes of the major scale. Each mode has a unique flavor:\n\n• Dorian: starts on the 2nd note — minor but brighter (jazz, funk)\n• Mixolydian: starts on the 5th note — major but bluesy (rock, blues)\n\nThink of it as seeing the same 7 notes from a different perspective."
