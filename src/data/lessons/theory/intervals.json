      "description": "An interval is the distance between two notes, measured in semitones (half-steps). A semitone is the smallest step on a piano — from any key to the very next key (including black keys). Understanding intervals is key to understanding chords, scales, and harmony."

      "description": "Here are the most important intervals:\n\n• Unison (0 semitones) — same note\n• Minor 2nd (1) — tension, dissonance\n• Major 2nd (2) — a whole step\n• Minor 3rd (3) — sad, dark feeling\n• Major 3rd (4) — happy, bright feeling\n• Perfect 4th (5) — open, strong\n• Perfect 5th (7) — very stable, powerful\n• Octave (12) — same note, higher pitch"
