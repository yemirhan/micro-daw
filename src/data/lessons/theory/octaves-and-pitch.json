      "title": "What is Pitch?",
      "description": "Pitch is how high or low a note sounds. It's determined by the frequency of vibration — faster vibrations = higher pitch. On the piano, notes get higher as you move right and lower as you move left. The distance of 12 semitones (all the keys in one group) is called an octave."

      "title": "Why Do Octaves Sound 'Same'?",
      "description": "When you go up one octave, the frequency exactly doubles. C4 vibrates at ~262 Hz, C5 at ~523 Hz. This 2:1 ratio is the simplest in music, which is why octaves sound so perfectly matched — our brains perceive them as the 'same' note at different heights."
